title: PhpStorm Plugin Development
---

Plugins for PhpStorm are developed in Java using either IntelliJ IDEA or PhpStorm. IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition does not support the PHP plugin.
IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition can be used to develop a PhpStorm plugin, but IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate must be used for testing.
 
You will also need a copy of PhpStorm to develop against. The [PsiViewer plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/227-psiviewer) will also be useful.

### PhpStorm Specifics

* [Setting-up the environment](setting_up_environment.md)
* [PHP Open API](php_open_api.md)
* [Example Third Party PhpStorm plugins](existing_plugins.md)
