title: Plugin Development

Plugins in PHPStorm developed in Java using IntelliJ IDEA (Community Edition is OK). You will also need a copy of PhpStorm to develop against. The PsiViewer plugin will also be most useful.

### PhpStorm Specifics
* [Setting-up the environment](setting_up_environment.md)
* [PHP Open API](php_open_api.md)
* [Existing 3rd party plugins](existing_plugins.md)
