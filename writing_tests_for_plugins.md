In this tutorial you will learn how to write and run automated tests for your plugin.

As an example we will take the plugin implemented in the

and cover its code with functional tests.

*  [Completion Test](completion_test.html)
*  [Annotator Test](annotator_test.html)
*  [Formatter Test](formatter_test.html)
*  [Rename Test](rename_test.html)
*  [Folding Test](folding_test.html)
*  [Find Usages Test](find_usages_test.html)
*  [Commenter Test](commenter_test.html)
