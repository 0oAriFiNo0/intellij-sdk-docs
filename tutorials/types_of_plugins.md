Main types of IntelliJ IDEA plugins
=========
IntelliJ IDEA can be modified and adjusted for particular purposes by adding plugins.
All the plugins which are already available for download can be found at [JetBrains Plugin Repository] (https://plugins.jetbrains.com/).
Most commonly used types of plugins are:
-----
* Custom language support
* Framework integration
* Tools integration
* User interface add-ons
The majority of already existing plugins are complex, so they combine multiple function, but generally these types can be marked out
