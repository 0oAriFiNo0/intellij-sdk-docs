This tutorial leads you through a series of steps which show how to create, register, and customize custom actions
and action groups. By registering actions, you can add your own menu items, toolbar buttons and keyboard shortcuts
to the IntelliJ IDEA user interface. For more information, please refer to the [IntelliJ Platform Action System](/basics/action_system.md)
documentation.
