> **NOTE** Please see [Testing Plugins](/basics/testing_plugins/testing_plugins.md) for a general introduction.

In this tutorial you will learn how to write and run automated tests for a custom language plugin.

As an example we will take the plugin implemented in the [Custom Language Support](/tutorials/custom_language_support_tutorial.md) and cover its code with functional tests.

*  [1. Tests Prerequisites](writing_tests_for_plugins/tests_prerequisites.md)
